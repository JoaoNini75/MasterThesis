\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{cha:conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0bp}

    \item{\emph{Task 1: Collection of case studies}}\hspace{1em}
    In March, we plan to select interesting cases where applying our work would be beneficial. 
    Some examples are compiler optimizations (and optimizations in general), reduction of higher-order functions to first-order and even code versioning, in the sense that refactoring or new features do not modify the behavior of previously correct code.

    \item \emph{Task 2: First-order product programs for OCaml}\hspace{1em} 
    Afterwards, and spanning across a month and a half, we will adapt the original work of product programs (which is based on the \emph{while} language) to the reality of OCaml, in the first-order context.

    \item \emph{Task 3: First-order implementation in Cameleer}\hspace{1em} 
    During two months, we plan on implementing the first-order OCaml approach in the Cameleer tool.

    \item \emph{Task 4: Extension of product programs to higher-order}\hspace{1em} 
    After that, in the month of July, we plan to extend our notion of product programs in OCaml to include some higher-order constructs focused on iteration, such as folds (left and right), map and iter.

    \item \emph{Task 5: Higher-order implementation in Cameleer}\hspace{1em} 
    In the following month, we will attempt to extend the implementation of product programs in Cameleer to include the higher-order functions mentioned in the previous task.

    \item \emph{Task 6: Dissertation Writing}\hspace{1em} 
    Finally, we will dedicate the entire month of September to write the dissertation.
