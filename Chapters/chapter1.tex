\section{Motivation}




\section{Problem Definition}

The question that this work focus its attention on is:

\begin{quote}
    \centering
    \emph{Is program P$_1$ equivalent to program P$_2$?}
\end{quote}

Despite looking like a simple question, there is no simple answer.
This is an issue that people have tried to address for decades, yet we did not find a definitive solution.
There are several schools of software verification~\cite{DBLP:conf/fm/BrainP24}, but, as expected, all of them have advantages and disadvantages.
However, we believe that human-assisted is the way, since it leaves many less bugs behind, compared to under-approximate methods and, at the same time, does not alert the programmer to errors that are not actually errors.
Of course that this carries an extra human effort, in developing the specification for the programs and sometimes in discharging verification conditions.

In the context of human-assisted verification, product programs appear as a promising solution that came to light from the combination of two other methods called self-composition and cross-products.
This solution takes the best of both worlds in order to overcome their limitations, which will be explained later, in chapter \hyperref[cha:state_of_the_art]{3}.
Our work will, therefore, adapt product programs to be applied in the OCaml programming language, which could then be verified using Cameleer.


\section{Goals and Expected Contributions}

This work aims to bring to OCaml the concept of \emph{product programs}, facilitating the task of proving that two different programs are behaviourally equivalent.
This is especially relevant in cases where proving a simpler program and the relation between that and a more complex version is more peaceful than proving the correctness of both versions separately.


\section{Report Structure}

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0.1em}
    \item Chapter \hyperref[cha:background]{2} contains a series of concepts, like relational Hoare logic, and tools, such as Cameleer, that are essential to understand the foundations of our work.

    \item In chapter \hyperref[cha:state_of_the_art]{3}, we will enumerate and explain the most relevant developments regarding the subject of program equivalence proof.

    \item Chapter \hyperref[cha:preliminary_results]{4} contains the current state of our practical results, more specifically, two proofs of equivalence of simple OCaml programs, using Cameleer.

    \item Finally, chapter \hyperref[cha:work_plan]{5} describes what will be our tasks, when they will start and how long they will take.

\end{itemize}
